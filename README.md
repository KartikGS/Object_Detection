# Object Detection
Using tensorflow framework to build a deep learning model that will detect hand signs from web cam and surround it with a bounging box.

## Data Collection
The following train and test sets were created using OpenCV and labelImg.<br>

## Model Used
From Tensorflow Zoo, the pretrained ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_320x320_coco17 model is used. Installed using Tenserflow Model Garden

## Packages

## Future Scope
To make a web app that detects hand signs making webpage browsing interactive.
